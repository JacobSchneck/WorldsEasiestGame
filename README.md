# M4OEP-Graphics-jschnec1

## To Run:
Use makefile. Go to terminal shell and run following command.

```console 
make
```
## Summary:

This program was inspired by the world's hardest game, an online flash game that involved moving a square through a level with dangerous obsticles. Unlike the world's hardest game though, this is very easy. The player (cyan square) needs to get to the goal (orange rectangle) and must avoid the death tangles (black rectangles). The nice thing about this project is that its fairly easy to build on, so maybe I will pick it back up once spring semester ends.

## Inputs: 
arrow keys to control the square, that all.

## References:
Lisa Dion was kind enough to allow us to use the shape and rectangle classes she made, so those are recycled from the guided projects with a few alterations.
